On July 26th, 2025, at the 2025 National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, brother Caroline Corbin of Tau Beta chapter was awareded the Robert E. Pope Oustanding Student Member award. This award is given to one student member each year who is deemed to best embody the pillars of Theta Tau not only in their capacity as a brother but throughout their entire life.

During her time with us, brother Corbin first served as our Corresponding Secretary for a year, starting a program which sent weekly newsletters to members and PNMs, as well as monthly newsletters to alumni. She then served as our Regent for three semesters, initiating an overhaul of our planning process and boosting organization, communication, and engagement from the chapter. She has also served as our Historian during the 2024-25 school year, revamping our social media presence. Engagement and presentation on our Instagram page has vastly improved under her watch, and she frequently was able to work with our Professional Development chair to use our Instagram to reach out to and communicate with alumni to have them come give presentations.

Brother Corbin’s commitment to the values of this Fraternity extends throughout her entire life and everything she does. I know no one who better embodies our open motto. She is always open to talk to a brother in need, and she makes this fact very clear: whether they need advice or just someone to listen, she’s there for them. 

Her involvement as president of SMU’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders has proved invaluable, as the organization has provided us with an excellent partnership to explore new avenues for service to our community. Furthermore, her commitment to the betterment of our community goes beyond her dedication to these organizations—she will advocate for sustainable development and service no matter where she is. Her commitment to professionalism also knows no bounds. Even after her tenure as Regent ended, she was still extremely active with the PD committee, getting involved and reaching out to alumni and speakers. But above all, everything she does, she does with the spirit and commitment of a Theta Tau.

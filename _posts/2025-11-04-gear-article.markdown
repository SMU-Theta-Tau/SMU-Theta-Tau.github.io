*The following is our article in the Fall 2025 edition of The Gear.*

The future is a vast expanse of unknowns. With every step forward, we are met with new challenges, unfamiliar paths, and questions that may not yet have answers. College is a time of growth that opens doors beyond our wildest imagination. While we may not know what lies ahead, we are not the first to walk this journey: we can look to brothers who have long since graduated for their experiences navigating this new wake of life. They’ve navigated the demanding academic journey, confronted professional crossroads, celebrated achievements, and endured setbacks. Their experiences, both triumphant and trying, provide a wellspring of knowledge that we can draw from.

This semester, our alumni partnered with our Professional Development Committee to host a series of events aimed at sharing their experience. They offered insight on transitioning into the workforce, handling career pivots, leveraging fraternity connections, and building meaningful professional relationships. Tau Beta Alumni answered tough questions, told us about their journeys, and reminded us that no path is linear--and that’s okay.

The events we hosted this semester ranged from a Question-Answer Panel on graduate school to a series of lecture based presentations about a day in the life of an engineer, possible career goals, and what to expect from the college experience. Brother Sydney Gibbs was the first to host a Professional Development presentation and discussion. Brother Gibbs has been known throughout the chapter for her experience and advice both academically and professionally. Later on, Brother Allison Pollard, recently elected into the Theta Tau Hall of Fame, returned to our chapter to share her expertise in career development and the necessity of soft skill development. Through these events, our Brothers were able to discuss accomplishments, worries, and further develop career growth plans.

“It’s incredibly valuable for our members to hear from alumni at different stages of their careers,” said Brother Carnline. “Sydney provided insightful guidance on navigating post-graduation challenges, while Allison leveraged her expertise in career coaching to empower our members in fostering meaningful professional connections.”

Alumni involvement did not stop at panels. Our alumni have attended chapter meetings, offered one-on-one mentorship, and helped open up internship opportunities for our active members. Their presence reinforces that being a brother doesn’t end at graduation; it evolves. It becomes a role of guidance, support, and example-setting. Whether through formal events or casual coffee chats, our alumni continue to pour into this chapter, helping us become the best versions of ourselves. The connection we share isn’t bound to campus. It lives on in every resume referral, every networking introduction, and every late-night phone call seeking advice. That kind of bond doesn’t disappear—it strengthens. Brotherhood isn’t just four years; it’s for life.

By sharing their stories—both the successes and the setbacks—our alumni empower us to aim higher. Their experiences offer a foundation we can build upon, allowing us to learn faster, reach further, and support each other better. Together, through mentorship and connection, we shape a future that’s brighter, stronger, and full of possibility. And for that, we thank them.
